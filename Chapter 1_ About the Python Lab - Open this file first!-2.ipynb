    "* The chapters include information, code examples, links to YouTube tutorials and activities for you to complete.  \n",
    "* You can complete the activities by editing cells where required, adding new code cells within the notebook and typing in your code. You will be guided through activities in each notebook and, by the end of the Programming Lab, will have learned how Python is an Object-Oriented Programming language where you can place different pieces of information together by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. \n",
