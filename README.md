# Introduction to Coding Workshop
## Python Lab for ISG Interns
## Welcome to the ISG Summer Interns Coding Workshop! 
This repository serves to host the teaching and learning content developed by EDINA, the centre for digital expertise at the University of Edinburgh, to provide materials for use with the Noteable service. 

As part of your August workshop learning about coding, you will copy and paste the link to this repository in Noteable to 'clone' all the included materials that you can use and work on. 

This repository is for coding activities developed in Jupyter notebooks and RStudio using the Noteable platform (www.noteable.edina.ac.uk) for those who are new to coding and want to learn about the history of code and how to get started with Python and some other programming languages, like R. 
You can use this content to learn about Python and gain an understanding of some core computing concepts, such as accessing coding environments, inputting code, marking down coding exercises and formatting activities, and building your own scripts and Python code to carry out mathemtical, visual and interactive tasks. 
This will include finding your favourite Free Fringe Venues for summer 2022! 

How to access these Notebooks on Noteable:

Click on the +GitRepo button
Paste into the Git Repository URL input the url from the web browser (in this case https://github.com/edina/Notebook-exemplars-for-GLOW-users)
Change the branch to main
click on Clone
All Coding Activities in this repository will now be available to you on Noteable
